# Graphs
- Node or vertex
- Nodes are connected with edges
- Graphs are useful for modeling real word cases (roads that connect cities)
  - Amazon uses it for recommendation engines
  - Google Maps uses graphs for determining the shortest paths
- Tree is a type of graphs

### Directed and Undirected Graphs
- Undirected graphs are bi-directional, you can traverse forward and backward
- Directed graphs only have one way, can't go backward

### Weighted and Unweighted graphs
- In graphs structures, not only nodes can have values
- The edges can also carry values
- That's the case of weighted graphs
  - It's great for calculationg optimal paths

### Cyclic and Uncyclic
- Cyclic are more common in weighted graphs
